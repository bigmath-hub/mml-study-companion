# Mathematics for Machine Learning - Study Companion

This repository contains Python implementation of mathematical concepts from the book **Mathematics for Machine Learning"** (Deisenroth, Faisal, Ong).

The goal is to build a solid fundation in Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability by translating theory into code (NumPy) from scratch

## Progress Log

### Part I: Mathematical Foundations

#### 1. Linear Algebra
Focus: Vectors, Matrices, Systems, and Vector Spaces.
- [x] **Linear Systems:** Solving $Ax=b$ and geometric interpretation.
- [x] **Linear Independence:** Checking redundancy using Matrix Rank.
- [x] **Basis and Rank:** Determining the intrinsic dimensionality of data using the Rank-Nullity theorem.

#### 2. Analytic Geometry
Focus: Norms, Inner Products, and Projections.
- [x] **Vector Geometry:** Computing $L1/L2$ Norms, Dot Products, and Angles.
- [x] **Metric Spaces:** Implementation of weighted inner products for non-Euclidean geometries.
- [x] **Projections:** Orthogonal projections onto 1D subspaces and residual error calculation.
